# Bayesian classifier

#### Dataset 
Dataset is using the built-in dataset from sklearn called iris flower.


# Bayesian network

# dataset specification
In this try out, I use data from [here](https://www.ccd.pitt.edu/wiki/index.php/Data_Repository)

`ASIA10k.csv`: A small "toy" network that models lung cancer in a patient from Asia.

# Different forms of Bayesian network
In order to simplify the complexity of the bayesian network eg. number of parameters are huge. We can use different simpler probabilistic model.
##### Simpler structure
1. naive bayesian net
2. Tree-augmented bayesian net
##### Simpler assessment of the conditional probabilieties 
1. parent divorcing 
2. causal independence bayesian net
